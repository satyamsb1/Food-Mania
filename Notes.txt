#Day-2 Igniting out app 
	- Things that work behind the scene and we dont know what happens
	- Things tha happen when we use create react app.
	- React cannot on individual level make our application fast; we need many packages to achive
	that speed.

	- Intro to npm;
		- packages and dependencies are same.
	- Bundler:-
		- Minification, Dependency Management, Optimization etc;
		- We are going to use parcel
		- We make production ready app using bundler. 
		- npm i -D parcel this is known as dev dependencies and used for development purposes.
		- npm i parcel these are used in production also.
